Task -> Authentication system for users using (JWT AUTH, MONGODB concepts and NEST JS) with Angular 17

Progress (22.04.24 06:00pm) -> Done with backend development part i.e. creation of REST:API endpoints like: 1.signUp 2. signIn 3. Reset Password.
All endpoints are tested.

-> MongoDb is used to store data and JWT to generate token.

What I learned today -> 1. Validation of data using class-validator
                        2. How to use JWT with Nest.Js 
                        3. How to connect MongoDB with Nest.js and few other basic concepts.

The user schema I am using looks like ->
{
    name:String;
    favBook:String;
    email:String;
    password:String;
}     

Explaination -> User will enter basic details like name, email and password but if user need to change his/her password they have to authenticate themselves by answering a basic question i.e. "Name your favourite book" if it matches then password will get updated in Database else error.

Thank you.
